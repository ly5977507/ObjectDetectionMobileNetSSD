## Object Detection
Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with 
detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos.
## MobilenetSSD
MobilenetSSD is an object detection model that computes the bounding box and category of an object from an input image. This 
Single Shot Detector (SSD) object detection model uses Mobilenet as backbone and can achieve fast object detection optimized for mobile devices.
